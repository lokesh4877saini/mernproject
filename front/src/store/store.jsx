//Store:

// The store holds the state of your entire app. In a large app, rather than having state in individual components, you centralize all your appâ€™s state in one place (the store).
// The store is immutable, meaning once the state is set, you can't change it directly. Instead, you send actions to the store to update the state.
// Actions:

// Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe something that happened in the app. Each action must have a type property, which is a string that describes the action.
// Actions can also carry data (payload), which helps modify the state.
// Reducers:
// Reducers are functions that define how the state changes in response to an action.
// Reducers take the current state and an action as arguments, and return a new state.
// The key point to remember is that reducers do not mutate the state; they return a new state object.
